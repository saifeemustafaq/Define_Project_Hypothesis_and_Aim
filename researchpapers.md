Based on the search results provided, there are a few relevant data-driven studies that examine the effects of physical activity and exercise on cognitive function in Alzheimer's disease (AD). While these don't specifically focus on mental health exercises, they do provide insights into how physical activity impacts cognition in AD patients:

1. Meta-analysis of physical activity and exercise interventions (Result 1):
This study analyzed data from 13 randomized controlled trials with a total sample size of 673 subjects diagnosed with AD. Key findings include:

- Intervention groups showed statistically significant improvement in cognition measured by MMSE scores (SMD = 1.12, CI: 0.66~1.59) compared to control groups.
- After excluding 6 studies based on funnel plots, they found positive overall random effects of physical activity/exercise interventions on cognitive function (SMD = 1.94, CI: 1.59~2.29).

2. Data-driven approach to understand Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) (Result 2):
While not specifically about Alzheimer's, this study used machine learning algorithms to predict MCI using a large dataset. They found that:

- Physical health and exercise were among the top important features affecting MCI.
- Other factors like depression, cigarette usage, education level, and sleep time also played important roles in cognitive decline.

3. Analyzing large Alzheimer's disease cognitive datasets (Result 3):
This paper discusses the challenges and considerations in analyzing cognitive test data from large AD datasets. While not a study itself, it highlights the importance of understanding the characteristics of cognitive tests when conducting data-driven research on AD.

4. Data-driven forecasting of agitation in persons with dementia (Result 4):
This study used deep learning models to predict agitation episodes in persons with dementia, based on environmental data collected from home environments. While not directly related to mental health exercises, it demonstrates the potential of data-driven approaches in AD research.

It's important to note that while these studies use datasets and data-driven approaches, they don't specifically focus on mental health exercises affecting Alzheimer's. To find studies that directly address mental health exercises and their impact on Alzheimer's using large datasets, you may need to conduct a more targeted search or explore more recent research in this specific area.
